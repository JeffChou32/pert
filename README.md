# pert
This project implements the PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) algorithm using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model tasks and their dependencies.

The algorithm calculates:

Earliest Start (ES) and Earliest Finish (EF) times

Latest Start (LS) and Latest Finish (LF) times

Slack for each task

The Critical Path, which determines the minimum project completion time.
